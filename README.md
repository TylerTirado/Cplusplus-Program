# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    CornerGrocerApp - This app was designed to count the frequency of all the items sold throughout the day 
    at CornerGrocer, it would read in the text file of all the items sold, and then count the frequency of 
    each item sold and then print them to a frequency data file that would serve as backup, it would contain 
    the item name along with the frequency of that item being sold. Next it would print a menu for the user 
    to choose between looking up an item by name and printing the frequency for that item, printing the frequency 
    for all items, printing the frequency of all items as a histogram with asterisks, and exiting the program.
  
# What did you do particularly well?
    I created code that was well organized and labeled which allows it to be added to whenever I would need to. 
    I used classes, functions, maps, etc. to help neaten up my main function and allow it to be added onto.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient,secure, and so on?
    I could improve my code by maybe editing how it receives a user word to search, instead of taking string entered 
    by the user, I should also remove any capital letters and punctuation. This would lessen the risk of not finding 
    a word just because you capitalized the wrong letter or added a period. This would mean I would also need to change 
    the strings from the text document to all lower case with no punctuation as well.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    The coding I had trouble with at first was setting up and using the map. It was difficult for me to get it to 
    increment the items correctly while it was reading the input file and adding them to the map. At first I 
    wanted to just try a different method of storing the data but I read that using map, although difficult at 
    first because of itâ€™s specific syntax, it would be much more efficient at doing what I was trying to do. 
    So after doing some research on Youtube, and StackOverflow, I was able to find some snippets of code and some 
    explanations that really stuck with me and helped me understand the problems I was having with storing the 
    correct frequency value and calling the correct part of the map when printing to the user.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    I think this project showcases a multitude of skills that would be transferable to other projects or course 
    work, knowing how to use different things such as classes, maps, reading input from files and outputting data 
    to files, and using different loop constructs is vital to excelling in a programming atmosphere.
    
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    By adding things like in line comments, using multiple functions instead of cluttering up the main function 
    and creating separate class files, it allows the code to be more readable and maintainable.
